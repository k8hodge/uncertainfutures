excerpt: Assess robustness and flexibility of Pareto optimal water supply sequences in multiple 10 year planning horizons, selecting a plan using an explicit efficiency-robustness tradeoff.
approach: summary of the type of problem and what concepts and methods were used to approach it, linking to other pages where appropriate
problem_definition: short summaries linking to concepts where appropriate. Multiple variations may be described, covering Alternatives, Scenarios, Objectives, constraints
