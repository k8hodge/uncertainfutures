excerpt: The analysis identifies optimal sequences of additional water supply options for a set of scenarios with different climate change, population growth, and discount rates. Sensitivity analysis shows how performance of each plan varies across scenarios, and which variables have greater influence, to help inform selection of an optimal sequence plan.
approach: summary of the type of problem and what concepts and methods were used to approach it, linking to other pages where appropriate
problem_definition: short summaries linking to concepts where appropriate. Multiple variations may be described, covering Alternatives, Scenarios, Objectives, constraints
