permalink: /examples/beh-2015-sequencing/
excerpt: A portfolio of water supply option sequences that are optimal under a range of plausible future conditions is generated. Next, global sensitivity analysis is used to assess the robustness of these sequences and to determine the relative contribution of future uncertain variables to this robustness.
approach: summary of the type of problem and what concepts and methods were used to approach it, linking to other pages where appropriate
problem_definition: short summaries linking to concepts where appropriate. Multiple variations may be described, covering Alternatives, Scenarios, Objectives, constraints
