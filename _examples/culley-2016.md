title: How much climate change can reservoir operations cope with in Lake Como?
citation: (Culley et al. 2016)
permalink: /examples/culley-2016/
excerpt: Vulnerability analysis building on decision scaling theory is used to identify changes in temperature and precipitation that would lead to flood or irrigation failures under current reservoir operations and optimal feedback control policies that increase the range of states under which minimum performance requirements are met.
approach: summary of the type of problem and what concepts and methods were used to approach it, linking to other pages where appropriate
problem_definition: short summaries linking to concepts where appropriate. Multiple variations may be described, covering Alternatives, Scenarios, Objectives, constraints
