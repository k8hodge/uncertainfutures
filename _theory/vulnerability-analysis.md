title: Vulnerability analysis
permalink: /theory/vulnerability-analysis/
excerpt: Vulnerability analysis identifies conditions in which management options can fail, either in terms of model parameter values or as scenarios.
purpose: >
  This is a form of <a href="../stress-testing/">stress testing</a> where the focus is specifically on identifying failures (or successes), as opposed to mapping performance or comparing alternatives.
requirements: A clear definition of success/failure is needed to identify a vulnerability.
decomposition: >
  <p>Both quantitative and qualitative methods can be applied, with or without a model.</p>
  Approaches include:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="../scenario-development/">Scenario development</a>, e.g. constructing narratives in which failure might occur</li>
  <li><a href="../scenario-discovery/">Scenario discovery</a>, which commonly identifies regions in model scenario space where policy failures occur.</li>
  <li><a href="../breakpoint-analysis/">Breakpoint analysis</a>, which identifies parameter values at which conclusions change, e.g. policy failures occur</li>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="../MORE/">Management Option Rank Equivalence (MORE)</a>, which uses optimisation to report the changes in each variable required to change the preferred management option</li>
  <li><a href="../crossover-point-scenarios/">Crossover point scenarios</a>, which identify the closest scenarios where the preferred option changes, either numerically or within participatory methods</li>
  <li><a href="../info-gap/">Info-gap decision theory</a></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

examples:
  - In a <a href="../../examples/guillaume-2015">simple flood demonstration problem</a> answering the question "Will regular flooding of ecological assets occur?", vulnerability analysis is performed analytically, using <a href="../scenario-discovery/">scenario discovery</a>, using <a href="../MORE/">POMORE</a> (a variant of MORE), and through <a href="../optimisation-based-hypothesis-testing/">optimisation-based hypothesis testing</a>
