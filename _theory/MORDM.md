title: Multi-objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM)
permalink: /theory/MORDM/
excerpt: MORDM is a method for robust decision making which combines interactive visual analytics with multi-objective optimisation to generate alternatives, evaluation of robustness metrics, scenario discovery to illuminate vulnerabilities, and trade-off analysis.
