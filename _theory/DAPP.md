title: Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP)
permalink: /theory/DAPP/
excerpt: DAPP is a framework to evaluate policy robustness and adaptiveness under deep uncertainty situations. The approach combines adaptive policymaking and adaptive pathways concepts and belong to the approaches categorised under the umbrella Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU).
purpose: >
  <p>DAPP  [1] aims at guiding the design of a robust and adaptive plan as a sequence of actions (near term and alternative actions) over time through [2]: <ul>
  <li> the exploration of sequences of decisions (adaptation pathways) under plausible futures (i.e., scenarios)</li>
  <li> making visible path dependency of alternative strategies (i.e., actions implemented when near term actions could no longer achieve societal objectives)</li></ul></p>
  <p> DAPP also supports participatory modelling through engaging stakeholders and decision makers in problem-solving activities [2,3]</p>
  <p> The approach was originally built to implement climate-resilient pathways for long-term water resources strategic planning and could be transfered to other long-term strategic planning under deep uncertainty [2,13] </p> 
  <p> The approach is useful [2]: <ul>
  <li> when applied to facilitate decision-making understanding and to support the acknowledgement of uncertainties in plans </li>
  <li> as an enabler for action </li>
  <li> when considering coupled physical-technical-human systems and long time planning horizons </li>
  <li> when considering the potential for implementing alternative adaptation actions to solve issues according to how the future may unfold </li> 
  </ul></p>
requirements: >
  <p> Operationalising the DAPP approach requires: <ul>
  <li> setting the scene for a system of interest and defining a vision [2] </li>
  <li> defining narratives describing future plausible conditions [2] </li>
  <li> identifying indicators of change for the system and for actions and associated threshold values [2]</li>
  <li> stakeholders' buy-in and engagement in relevant activities [3] </li>
  <li> considering the intervention of local knowledge-brokers to facilitate the application of the approach and stakeholder engagement [3] </li>
  </ul></p>
decomposition: >
  <p> The DAPP framework could be decomposed into seven main iterative steps [2]:<ol>
  <li> Participatory problem framing including the description of a system of interest boundaries, performance objectives, current and future vulnerabilities. The result of this context setting stage is the definition of conditions of success for the system that would be used to evaluate the performance of policy options and the system itself against plausible future scenarios. Identified vulnerabilities is used to :<ul>
  <li> select plausible policy measures (based on manageable vulnerabilities)</li>
  <li> define plausible narratives about future changes (based on non-manageable vulnerabilities) that could be either static (i.e., with an end point into the future) or transient (describing developments over time) [10]</li></ul></li>
  <li> Identification of conditions and timing of failure (adaptation tipping points (ATPs)) for the system when facing different future scenarios. Approaches to identify ATPs (i.e., threshold values) include: <ul>
  <li> 'bottom-up' approaches: stress tests, sensitivity analyses, scenario discovery [5], expert judgement [1], stakeholder consultation [3]</li>
  <li> 'top-down' approaches: model-based assessement using static or transient [9] scenarios </li></ul></li>
  <li> Identification of alternative actions based on step 1 and 2, to address identified vulnerabilities or opportunities, and determination of their ATPs </li>
  <li> Design and assessment of the adaptive pathways. This stage leads to the design of a pathway map, also defined as "metro map", to achieve a performance objective for the system. Opportunities, no-regret actions, lock-ins and their associated timing of implementation under changing conditions are inferred from the map. Methods to develop and explore adaptive pathways include:<ul>
  <li> drawn manually </li>
  <li> using an application dedicated to that purpose such as the Pathways Generator [4] </li>
  <li> based on models such as ABM [14], Multi-objective robust optimisation models [6], serious games [7,8] </li>
  <li> during stakeholder focus group discussions [3]</li>
  <li> using a combimation of model-based assessment and group discussions </li></ul>
  The performance of each pathway is then evaluated and recorded in a scorecard. Methods of evaluation include:<ul>
  <li> cost-benefit analysis </li>
  <li> multi-criteria analysis [12] </li>
  <li> real options analysis [12] </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li> Design of the adaptive strategy in terms of selection of near term and alternative (long-term) actions. In addition, contingency actions are considered to support the achievement of the selected pathways. Also, a monitoring plan, describing signposts (indicators) and triggers (threshold values) for implementing or not actions according to future conditions, is designed </li>
  <li> Implementation of the adaptive plan </li>
  <li> Monitoring of the strategy and re-evaluation of the plan, if necessary </li>
  </ol></p>

  - Application of DAPP for the Dutch Delta Programme to support adaptive planning for flood protection in the face of future climate and socio-economic changes. The approach was used to develop adaptation pathways displaying how different measures address different physical conditions and to estimate when such conditions could occur and under which conditions [11]
