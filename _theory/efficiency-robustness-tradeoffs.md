title: Efficiency-robustness tradeoffs
permalink: /theory/efficiency-robustness-tradeoffs/
excerpt: Systems often exhibit a trade-off between efficiency and robustness. Management options that are efficient in one scenario may perform poorly in others. Options that perform well across scenarios may not perform as well as a less robust alternative. In tackling multiple plausible futures, this trade-off needs to be acknowledged, and can be explicitly analysed.
