title: Decision scaling
permalink: /theory/decision-scaling/
excerpt: Decision scaling is a method that links bottom‐up vulnerability assessment with multiple sources of climate information.  It uses stochastic analysis to identify how climate affects objectives and uses runs from global climate models to then estimate probabilities of decision-relevant climate states.
