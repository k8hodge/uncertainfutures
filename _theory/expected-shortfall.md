permalink: /theory/expected-shortfall/
excerpt: Expected shortfall is a probabilistic measure of risk (also called conditional value at risk, CVaR) which measures the average return of a management option for the worst cases, in the tail of a probability distribution. When faced with multiple plausible futures without probabilistic information, robustness metrics focused on the worst cases can be used as an alternative.
