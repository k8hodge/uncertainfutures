excerpt: Decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) is an umbrella concept with a focus on helping decision makers identify and evaluate robust and adaptive strategies.
purpose: >
  <p>Deep uncertainty exists when parties to a decision do not know, or cannot agree on, the system model that relates action to consequences, the probability distributions to place over the inputs to these models, which consequences to consider and their relative importance. [1]</p>
  <p>The definition of DMDU is typically interpreted as requiring the future to be described in terms of <a href="../multiple-plausible-futures/">multiple plausible futures</a>, and therefore focusing on identifying <a href="../robust-decisions/">robust</a> and <a href="../adaptive-decisions/">adaptive</a> decisions.</p>
  <p>The decision situation described by DMDU, however, includes broader elements, and a research and practitioner community has developed around this definition, which offers further support.</p>

decomposition: >
  <p>Given its focus on multiple plausible futures, this website covers a range of key concepts of DMDU, including <a href="../exploratory-modelling/">exploratory modelling</a> and <a href="../robust-decisions/">robust</a> and <a href="../adaptive-decisions/">adaptive</a> decisions.</p>
  <p>A range of named methods are also covered, including <a href="../robust-decision-making/">"robust decision making"</a> and <a href="../DAPP/">"dynamic adaptive policy pathways" (DAPP)</a>, which are also discussed in an Open Access book on DMDU [2].</p>
  <p>The DMDU Society [1] organises regular meetings and training.</p>
# TODO: This text can updated to link to all methods in the DMDU book once they are available
