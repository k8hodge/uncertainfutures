title: Pareto optimality
permalink: /theory/pareto-optimality/
excerpt: A management option is "Pareto optimal" if there is no alternative that would perform better on all objectives. When the relative importance of objectives is contested, Pareto optimal solutions are commonly illustrated with a trade-off curve, such that decision makers can use information about the trade-off to select a preferred alternative.
