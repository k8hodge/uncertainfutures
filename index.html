  Decision making in the face of
  <a href="theory/multiple-plausible-futures/">multiple plausible futures</a> is
  emerging as a key capability in the face of global and climate change. The
  future is described not by forecasts or probability distributions, but by
  multiple "<a href="theory/scenario-development/">scenarios</a>". This is also
  called <a href="theory/dmdu/">Decision making under deep uncertainty</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We need to make decisions that are "<a href="theory/robust-decisions/"
    >robust</a
  >" or "<a href="theory/adaptive-decisions/">adaptive</a>". We use methods and
  tools for <a href="theory/exploratory-modelling/">exploratory modelling</a>,
  which explore the implications of varying assumptions and hypotheses. We can
  search through scenarios to "<a href="theory/stress-testing/">stress test</a>"
  decision alternatives and identify
  <a href="theory/vulnerability-analysis/">vulnerabilities</a> to
  <a href="theory/management-options/">design better management options</a>.

  This website synthesises theoretical materials, software tools and examples
  about decision making in the face of multiple plausible futures. If in doubt,
  start <a href="theory/multiple-plausible-futures/">here</a>.
